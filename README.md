# Bootstrap 5 UI Remix Project

## Project Files
- `index.html` - Home page (Navbar, Hero, Features)
- `about.html` - About / Services
- `contact.html` - Contact form (front-end only)

## How I completed the project
1. Reviewed Bootstrap 5 documentation and examples.
2. Extracted components (navbar, cards, hero, forms) and remixed them into original layouts.
3. Ensured responsiveness using Bootstrap grid and utilities.
4. Tested in multiple viewport sizes.

## AI / Tools used
- I used guidance from ChatGPT for structure and wording, and Bootstrap official docs for component usage.

## Challenges & Solutions
- Creating original layouts: solved by remixing components and using Bootstrap utilities instead of copying full templates.
- Form backend: the contact form is front-end only; to make it functional you can connect Netlify Forms, Formspree, or a simple server.

## Time Taken
Approximately 6 hours (design, coding, testing, and packaging).

## Deployment
See `deploy-instructions.md` for step-by-step GitHub Pages and Netlify deployment commands.
